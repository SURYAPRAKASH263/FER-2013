# FER-2013
# PROBLEM STATEMENT
Recognize facial expressions using a CNN model on the FER-2013 dataset.
Load and preprocess the FER-2013 dataset.Build a CNN model using Keras/TensorFlow.Train the model on the training set and evaluate it on the test set.Experiment with different CNN architectures to improve accuracy.Visualize the learned feature maps and predictions.
